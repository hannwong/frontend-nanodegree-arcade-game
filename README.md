# Getting Started

Start a web server via ``python3 -m http.server``.

Point your browser to ``localhost:8000``.

# Playing the game

You control a player entity that starts at the middle of bottom row.

Using keys ``up``, ``down``, ``left`` and ``right``, you control the player entity.

The aim is reach the river at the top row, while avoiding the enemy entities (bugs).

Once you reach the river, the game will reset.
Upon your feature request, I can add some satisfying effects (maybe scores and more) upon your winning this game.

If you are hit by any enemy, the game will also reset.
I could add some pause when this happens, so you see how and where you were hit.

(Please consider helping me find a job along with sending me your feature requests. I'm starving! :-P)
